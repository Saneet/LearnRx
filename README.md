# LearnRx
Test driven exercises to learn and practice RxJava.

## How to use
Open RxBasicsTest.java and write code to pass all the tests.

## Rules
1. You can only change the respective functions in the file RxBasics.java.
2. Every solution will consist of a single Rx chain, i.e. only one semicolon per function.

## Tips
1. The test title tells the concept it is trying to demonstrate.
2. The test will tell exactly...
    1. which functions to call.
    2. what parameters to pass.
    3. when to call those functions.
    4. what output it expects.
